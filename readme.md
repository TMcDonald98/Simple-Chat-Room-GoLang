# Chat in Go #

This project creates a server and client(s) for simple terminal-based chatting using WebSockets (golang.org/x/net/websocket).

Run the server first:
`go run server/main.go` 

and in different terminals run then the clients...
`go run client/main.go` x2, or x3 or x10

...in different terminal windows. Type a message in one client's terminal and see in sent to every client!
